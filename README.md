# Dragon rollplaying game

This is a role-playing game where the goal is to save the city's population by slaying a dragon. Throughout the game, the player will need to purchase both health and weapons to reach the ultimate objective. Strategic decision-making is crucial for the player in this game.

Now the game workes I will spend some time with the design. I decided to draw my own pictures that I will add to the game. I will also add some soundeffects in differens elements.

After the game has been tested, I have decided to make some updates. I will make it so that the player starts at level 1 but can then increase their level during the game, and which level the player stands on depends on what they can do in the game.

## Todo:

~-add font to head text<br>~
~change the font family<br>~
~-add icons<br>~
-draw pictures<br>
-add pictures <br>
